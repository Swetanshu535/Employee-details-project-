This project contains data based on which dashboard is made 

Excited to share my latest project on employee data analysis and dashboard creation! ðŸŽ‰ This project revolves around key aspects of employee demographics and performance, captured through a detailed dataset. The dataset includes fields like Education, Joining Year, City, Payment Tier, Age, Gender, Ever Benched status, Experience in Current Domain, and whether an employee has taken leave.

Using this data, I've tackled several insightful questions to reveal trends and patterns:

ðŸ”¹ Education and Experience: A deep dive into the correlation between employees' education levels and their years of experience within their current domains.

ðŸ”¹ Age and Gender Distribution: I explored the total age distribution, segmented by gender, providing a clear view of the age demographics across the workforce.

ðŸ”¹ Payment Tier and Location: By analyzing the total payment tier for employees in different cities, I was able to uncover regional trends in compensation.

ðŸ”¹ Joining Year and Ever Benched: I looked into the relationship between the year employees joined and whether they have ever been benched, revealing insights into workforce management.

ðŸ”¹ Gender and Leave Status: Finally, I examined the total number of employees who took leave, broken down by gender, to identify any trends in leave patterns.

This project has been a great learning experience in leveraging data to drive meaningful insights and create a dashboard that brings employee metrics to life. Stay tuned for more insights from this project! #DataAnalytics #EmployeeData #Dashboard #HRAnalytics
